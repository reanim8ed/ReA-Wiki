### SIM

* There is a sim card shop just to your right as you as you enter the arrival hall from the baggage

### Train

* Even though the airport is called TLV it's not actually in Tel Aviv, but rather 15km away in the town of Lod. A further 20 minute drive is needed to get to Tel Aviv. This trip can be done by train, shuttle, or taxi from Ben Gurion airport.
* A single-ride ticket to the city for ₪13.50. Access to the station is from Level G in Terminal 3, the same level as Arrivals - when you get out of the gate just walk left and follow signs. Buy a ticket from the cashier or from an automatic machine, and use it to enter the platform area. Keep the ticket to exit the electronic gate at your destination station. Trains to the stations in the center of Tel Aviv leave from platform 2, heading for Nahariya.
* The train service operates around the clock on weekdays, with 2 trains per hour (as of April 2019 they leave at :05 and :35) most of the day and one per hour at night. On weekends and Jewish holidays, from Friday afternoon till Saturday evenings, it doesn't operate (As of November 2007, the last departure from the airport on Friday is at 14.37, the first departure on Saturday at 19.35. During day-light saving time trains start 2 hours later on Saturdays). Trains stop at all four Tel Aviv stations, with the exception of late night trains that stop only at Tel Aviv Merkaz/Savidor station.
* The stations are, in order of arrival from the airport: Tel Aviv HaHagana (12 minutes travel), Tel Aviv HaShalom (13 minutes), Tel Aviv Merkaz/Savidor (18 minutes), Tel Aviv University (25 minutes). For best access to the city center, use either "Tel Aviv Merkaz" (a.k.a. "Arlozorov" and officially named "Savidor"), or "Hashalom" (located next to a large shopping mall).

### Places

* Ochel bar in carmel market
* The Nachalat Binyamin market is one of Israel’s biggest arts and crafts markets and a superb place to browse for original Tel Aviv souvenirs (think ceramics, toys, paintings, framed photos and Judaical pieces); all handmade and sold by their artist creators!
* Florentin - hipsterdome
* Neve tsedek region - Tel Aviv’s prettiest neighborhood. Grab a cone at Anita — one of the city’s best ice cream shops — and get lost in the area. Dallal is a great place to stop for lunch, or if you’re up for a second ice cream, try Granny’s Ice cream (Glida Savta) in the Suzan Dallal Art Center.
* Take a stroll down Rothschild Blvd, and Dizengoff and Bialik streets for the best of the White City!
* Park HaYarkon
* Gordon beach
* One of the oldest port cities in the world, Jaffa’s Old City is a maze of stores and cafes that spill over into Jaffa’s flea market. Head to the port for some fresh fish, or get lost in the winding alleys of the Twelve Signs.

### Food

* Abu Hassan (Shivtei Israel 14, Jaffa) is the most likely contender for best hummus in town. They used to only offer hummus, but have recently expanded to also offer chips (fries) and salads. Prepare to queue for a while to get a seat, especially on the busy Friday lunchtime session, but it’s totally worth it. Get there before 14:00.
* Malavi - jogurt
* Shwarma - slices of turkey, chicken or lamb, which are usually shaved off a huge slab of meat rotating (vertically) on a big spit. Similar in style to the Turkish doner kebab.
* Shakshooka - egg pan
* Arayes
* Sabich or sabih is an Israeli sandwich based on a traditional Iraqi Jewish dish prepared for Shabbat. It consists of pita stuffed with fried eggplant, hard boiled eggs, Israeli salad, parsley, amba and tahini sauce.
