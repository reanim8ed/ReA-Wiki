### **A**ssumptions

* [Conjunction fallacy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conjunction_fallacy) - [formal fallacy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Formal_fallacy) that occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.
* [Occam’s Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) — “Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.”
* [Zebra ](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Zebra_%28medicine%29)- American medical slang for arriving at an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely. "When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras".
* [Cognitive bias](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cognitive_bias) - a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals create their own "subjective reality" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behavior in the world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.

### Creative Destruction

Motivated by personal incentives, entrepreneurs will push to best one another in a never-ending game of creative one-upmanship, in the process destroying old ideas and replacing them with newer technology. Beware getting left behind.

### Distribution

* [Pareto principle](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pareto_principle) - for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

### Economics

* [Diminishing returns](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Diminishing_returns) - in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production, while holding all others constant, will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns.

### Intentions

* [Hanlon’s Razor](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hanlon%27s_razor) — “never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness.”
* [Fundamental attribution error](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fundamental_attribution_error) - also known as **correspondence bias** or **attribution effect**, is the tendency for people to under-emphasize situational explanations for an individual's observed behavior while over-emphasizing dispositional and personality-based explanations for their behavior. This effect has been described as "the tendency to believe that what people do reflects who they are".

Assume good intent until proven otherwise. Your parent is not your enemy. Your teacher is not your enemy. Your boss is not your enemy. The other team at work is not your enemy. The corporation is not your enemy. The other political party is not your enemy. Or, more accurately, YOU are not THEIR enemy. Most of the time there isn't a conspiracy against you, there are simply incentives that you don't understand.   
It’s worth remembering that even if someone is an enemy it is in conflict with you, nobody thinks they are “the bad guy”. If you want to understand why someone does what they do, you can’t chalk it up just to “they’re evil” or “they’re crazy”. There’s some reason why they’re doing what they do and to them, they feel like they’re on the right side.

### Opportunity Costs

Doing one thing means not being able to do another. We live in a world of trade-offs, and the concept of opportunity cost rules all. Most aptly summarized as “there is no such thing as a free lunch.”

### Scientific method

A method is termed scientific if it can be stated in such a way that a certain defined result would cause it to be proved false. Pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science operate and propagate by being unfalsifiable – as with astrology, we are unable to prove them either correct or incorrect because the conditions under which they would be shown false are never stated.

### Specialization

* Rather than having a group of workers each producing an entire item from start to finish, Smith explained that it’s usually far more productive to have each of them specialize in one aspect of production. He also cautioned, however, that each worker might not enjoy such a life; this is a trade-off of the specialization model. - tinka programavimui
* Most humans have the tendency to need to act, even when their actions are not needed. We also tend to offer solutions even when we do not have knowledge to solve the problem.

### Traveling

When we dream about travelling, we do so because we think we'd be happier somewhere else. In fact, usually, the place doesn't matter, as long as it's just not here.  
When we arrive and actually experience the destination, our old modes of thinking persist. We get bored, distracted, worry about details, and spend very little time taking it in.  
Only in our memories of our journey does the trip take on an ephemeral form again, where we edit out and forget everything except the most potent few moments.
