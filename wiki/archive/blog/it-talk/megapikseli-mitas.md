# Megapikselių mitas

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/camera_by_coach_money_thumb.jpg)

Ech, aiškink neaiškinęs žmonėm, o vis vien į protą atvesti neišeina. Manim netikit, tai bent jau žinovo paklausykit:

_**Higher megapixels does not mean that your camera is better.** If I have an EOS SLR camera of 8 megapixels, it is capable of taking far superior photographs than your 12 megapixels point and shoot camera. Why? Because it all depends on the sensor that’s inside the camera and not the megapixel count. If you are a casual photographer who uses a camera just for taking the photographs and viewing/uploading them on a computer, a 4 megapixel is more than enough for you. **Megapixels in no way define the quality of photographs.** The megapixel count can only determine how big you can print your pictures._
