* “Mushroom management” is where employees aren’t told about the ideas or general state of the company, and are given work without knowing its purpose. So called because they are “kept in the dark and fed bullshit” [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mushroom\_management](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mushroom_management)
