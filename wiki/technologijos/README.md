# Technologijos

* Something I explained to my 10 yo last night: Some areas of science and technology will advance a lot more than others in the next 50 years, and you can't predict which. All we can say for sure about the future is that some things will change a lot, and others hardly at all. - Paul Graham
* Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.  Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

### Vinilinės plokštelės

* Reggie Watts kalbėdamas pas Rogan'ą apie [vinilines plokšteles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOqyIJvtTuk), jų pranašumus ir trūkumus, mestelėjo išties puikią mintį: Nesuprasdavau, kodėl HiFi sistemos yra tokios brangios, kol vieną dieną ne toptelėjo suvokimas: visa tai yra ne apie pinigus, o _what does it take to engineer a machine that becomes invisible to the experience._
