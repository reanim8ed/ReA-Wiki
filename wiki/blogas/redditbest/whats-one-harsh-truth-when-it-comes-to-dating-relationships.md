# What’s one harsh truth when it comes to dating/relationships?

You can do everything right and he/she may still leave you anyway, for things or issues beyond anyone’s control…  
„It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.“ That’s RNG.

No matter what she says, she will always steal some of your fries. Be prepared for that  
JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD.  
This is called the Relationship Tax.

Your SO is statistically the person most likely to murder you.  
All of a sudden my life feels a lot more dangerous.

You will create an ideal version of them based on your own expectations and desires and hormones, and that version does not exist, and you will eventually realize it.

You still need to have your own life outside of the relationship  
„If you’re not happy on your own, how can you make someone else happy?“

Love is NOT all you need. This fairy tale keeps people in relationships longer than necessary. Sometimes you can love each other deeply and the relationship is still shit. It’s the most sad kind of breakup, but sometimes it needs to happen.

You don’t always get as much out of it as you put into it.

For the kids in High School: No matter what you think he/she probably isn’t „The One.“

Both of you will have to change things about yourself, and make compromises that will mean you don’t always get to do or have things exactly as you want.  
People always say things like „be true to yourself – if he loves you he’ll accept you as you are“, except the way you conduct yourself when you are single is different to how you conduct yourself when you are in a relationship. If you live together and you say you’re going out for a few drinks but then get wasted and don’t come home until morning without a call or text, then you’re a bit of a shit partner.

If they cheat with you they’ll cheat on you. I thought I was the exception; I was not.
