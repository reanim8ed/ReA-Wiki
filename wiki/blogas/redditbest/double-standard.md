# Double standard

**Reddit, what is one double standard that is totally bullshit?**

-Not really sure if it’s considered a double standard necessarily, but…while working in a restaurant it’s perfectly ok for people to go outside and take a smoke break, but if I, a non smoker, want to step outside for a few minutes just to sit or talk on the phone it’s considered slacking off.

-I complained to my old boss about this same thing years ago.  
„Smokers get smoke breaks.“ Is pretty much what I was told.  
So, I started my own addiction. I went to the dollar store and bought some bubbles. Then, every two hours I would go outside and blow bubbles for 10 minutes. Nobody complained – not even my boss. They all thought it was kind of funny. I did it for another year or so until I quit to start my own business.  
I’ve cut down since then. I’m down to about two bottles a week.

Oh, and I’m a man in my 40’s.
