* Įsivaizduokite – jaunas žmogus susižavi repu. Pirmiausia, ką jis daro pradžioje tai rengiasi plačiais drabužiais – rūpinasi savo išvaizda vien tam, kad likęs pasaulis suvoktų, jog jis reperis ir jį taip priimtų. Jis repuoja apie žolę, kurios niekada nerūkė, apie gatves ir t.t. Aš nepašiepiu, tik noriu pasakyti, kad jaunas žmogus nori būti kažkam priskiriamas. Bėgant laikui, jeigu jis išlieka subkultūroje, pradeda atsisakyti jos pradinių įvaizdžio detalių. Jis gali netgi nebenešioti plačių drabužių. Pats juos nešioju iki šiol, nes niekada gyvenime nemėgau kai į mane trinasi drabužiai. Net jeigu nerepuočiau, juos nešiočiau. Pažįstu metalistus, kurie vaikšto su siaurais džinsais, be ilgų plaukų ir su paprastomis striukėmis, nors jie daug metų klauso tik metalą ir labai jį myli.

### Žmonės nebedirba

Iš vaikiškos knygelės „Ką žmonės dirba visą dieną?“

_Vaikai, šiais laikais žmonės nebedirba. Jie tik eina į darbą ir ten užsiima kas kuo:  
Štai žurnalistai – pliurpia.  
Mokslininkai – tyrinėja. Bomžai – irgi tyrinėja. Konteinerius.  
Ofiso planktonas – žaidžia kompiuteriu.  
Policininkai – važinėjasi. Pardavėjos – nuobodžiauja. Seimūnai – važinėjasi ir nuobodžiauja.  
Kurie nori pabūti seimūnais – žada. Žada maždaug kaip vaikinas merginai likę dviese.  
Prezidentė – barasi. Premjeras – aiškina. Politologai paaiškina juos abu.  
Finansų ministrė – neduoda. Niekam arba truputį kai kam. Kai kurios moterys irgi neduoda. Niekam arba truputį kai kam._

### Momentum of the time

_„History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of ‘history’ it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened . . . There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning . . . And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave . . . So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.“ **– Hunter S. Thompson – Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream**_

Keista, kai trumputė citata sugeba iššaukti auksinę nostalgiją tiems laikams, kuriems aš esu per jaunas ir kurių net neturėjau galimybės patirti.

### What's Wrong With Science Fiction

* So what's gone wrong? What happened to the genre that once held such towering giants such as Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, and Arthur C. Clarke \(other than the fact that all three are dead\)?

  I think that the answer lies in society's perception of what the "future" is. When science fiction got its start back in the post-war period, the future was all jet-packs and flying cars: the GE Home Of Tomorrow, the Nuclear Family \(both socially and literally\), the whole World's Fair Promise of the Future ideal. Science fiction channeled this optimism, putting men on Mars and fighting evil Aliens from Outer Space in shiny space ships with neat-o ray guns.

  It wasn't, of course, going to stay this rosy for long. The Atomic Bomb revealed the other side of the coin on all this futurism: death and destruction. Science Fiction, however, thrived. The 50s and 60s were a great time for what's now called "hard" Science Fiction: Asimov's Robot Novels \(1954, 1957\), as well as his Galactic Empire series in the early 1950s; Clarke released the highly influential Childhood's End in 1953; and Heinlein's Starship Troopers \(1959\), Stranger in a Strange Land \(1961\), and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress \(1966\) all during this period, as well as innumerable quantities of short fiction.

### Minčių generavimas rytais

* Лучшие мои идеи рождались в хаосе и я начал это использовать. Каждое утро мне надо минимум полчаса \(и кофе\) чтобы собраться с мыслями и начать жить. Однако, это состояние оказалось идеальным для генерации новых идей. Мысли сами соединяются в случайном порядке потому что основная часть мозга еще не проснулась и не сказала всем собраться и жить правильно.

### Get Mad!

 Ištrauka iš 1976-metų filmo “[Network](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/)”:

I _don’t have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It’s a depression. Everybody’s out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel’s work, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there’s nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there’s no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TV’s while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that’s the way it’s supposed to be. We know things are bad – worse than bad. They’re crazy. It’s like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don’t go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, ‘Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won’t say anything. Just leave us alone.’Well, I’m not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don’t want you to protest. I don’t want you to riot – I don’t want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn’t know what to tell you to write. I don’t know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you’ve got to get mad.  
\[shouting\] You’ve got to say, ‘I’m a HUMAN BEING, Goddamnit! My life has VALUE!’ So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell,  
\[shouting\]  
‘I’M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I’M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!’  
Then we’ll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it:  
\[screaming at the top of his lungs\] "I’M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I’M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!"_
