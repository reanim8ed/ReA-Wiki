### Set Up Your MacBook for Web Development <a href="#c030" id="c030"></a>

A guide to getting your Macbook ready for web development — tools, shortcuts, accessories, tips and tricks, and more.

I recently switched jobs, and during the first few days on the new job, I had to setup a MacBook with all the tools required for me to do my job, web development. Although, I’ve used Macs for a long time, at my previous job I was developing on a PC with Windows 10. It was surprisingly pleasant and productive once I got [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) up and running, but I’m really glad to have a Mac as my primary workstation once again.

Every now and then, I look for guides like this one to see what tools people are using and to get productivity tips. And almost always I learn about something new that makes my life as a developer easier. I’ve kept notes of all the things I installed and configured during the first weeks on the new job hoping it’d be useful to other developers.
