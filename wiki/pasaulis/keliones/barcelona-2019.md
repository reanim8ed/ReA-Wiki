* Allocate 4-6 hours to visit Montserrat properly.
* The España rail station is on the green and red metro lines making it accessible from any part of Barcelona city centre that has a metro stop.
* Once at España look for **Line R5** headed towards Manresa. Ferrocarril’ train
* It's advisable to arrive at España station in plenty of time as it can be a little confusing to find R5 track. The España rail station is quite large and the directions to the R5 track could be clearer.
* from Plaça España to either the starting point to take the Cable Car ride \(Aeri\) or the starting point for the Rack Railway \(Cremallera\) which are at the foot of Montserrat mountain. For the Rack Train ride you will need to get off one stop after **Aeri de Montserrat** called Monistrol. The Rack Train ride will take 15 minutes to the Monastery
* There is no entrance fee to the Monastery however if you wish to visit the museum you will have to pay an entrance fee. 7€
* There is a restaurant at Montserrat mainly serving sandwiches. I recommend you also bring plenty of water, especially if you want to do some walking in the mountains. Just past the funicular station there’s a convenience store to buy snacks and drinks for your hike. Try the Aromes de Montserrat liquor \(a 12 herb liquor invented by the monks\).
* Keep an eye on the time as the Cable car only runs till around 18:40.
* Once you’ve arrived at Montserrat monastery with the cable car or funicular you can start your hiking adventure. Just get yourself to the tourist information booth, grab a map with a list of trails, and head for nature! It’s also the best place for **hiking** because of the sheer **variety of trails**. With 5 different options ranging from 2.7 km to 7.5 km you’ll find the hike for your level of difficulty. The Sant Joan funicular takes you to the very peak of the mountain

#### 04-19 - BUNKERS DEL CARMEL

* It is found in an unspoiled, natural setting that hasn’t sold out to tourists.
* It’s free!
* Public drinking is widely tolerated so you’ll have no problems. Just make sure to bring some water as well because the hike is a bit tiring. Add some bread, chorizo, and cheese and maybe something sweet and you’ve got the perfect meal or sunset snack.
* If you’re coming from the Gothic Quarter or Raval grab the 24 bus from Plaça de Catalunya and continue about 20 minutes uphill and get off at the ‘Doctor Bové Gran Vista’ stop – it’s number 268. Or metro: taking the blue line \(L5\) of the metro to El Carmel. Head out through the Llobregas exit and walk down to bus 86.

#### 04-20 - La Rambla / LA BOQUERIA MARKET / Gothic Quarter / Plaça de Catalunya

### Tips

* Skip restaurants and cafes if they have a menu with pictures, especially if they’re posted out front. I’m not saying you’ll eat horribly, but generally these are the tourist traps, and you won’t find authentic food there \(plus it will probably be overpriced\). If there is an employee waiting outside to greet you, don’t go in. If the menu is translated into a million languages, don’t go in.
* Eat the Menú del Día. Most authentic, local restaurants offer a “menu of the day,” which is a 2-4 course meal at a discounted price for lunch time \(depending on the restaurant, the price can be as low as 10 euros!\). This is most common to find Monday-Friday, but it is possible to find some restaurants serving it on the weekends as well.
* Many restaurants don’t open until 1pm for lunch, and don’t get busy until about 2pm. Don’t expect to have dinner until at least after 8pm! Locals generally don’t eat until 10pm or even later.
* La Rambla. The most recognized and touristic street in Barcelona, connecting Plaça de Catalunya with the Columbus monument and port. There are hundreds of street vendors and performers, so it can be nice to take a stroll on a sunny day. I recommend not stopping to eat/drink at any of the bars and restaurants along the way \(they’re ridiculously overpriced and touristy\). If you want to stop for a bite, walk for a few minutes along the side streets until you get out of the main tourist hub and you’ll find much better options. Also, don’t take pictures of any of the performers unless you’re willing and ready to pay for it! The Rambla’s famous Boqueria Market is closed on April 19th
