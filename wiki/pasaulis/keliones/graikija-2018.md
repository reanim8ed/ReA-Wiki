## **Kelionės info**

### **SIM**

* Vodaphone now has a kiosk at arrival gate a. 22€ for 300 minutes and 8 gig

### **Tickets**

* **If you plan to stay in Athens for up to 3 days**, you should consider purchasing a 3-day tourist ticket \(€22\) upon your arrival at the airport. Especially if you travel between the airport and the city center by Metro, and also take a few shorter rides while in Athens, this should be the best ticket for you. However, if you’re going to use an express bus for the airport \(€6 per route\) and then take the metro while in the city just a few times it might be better purchasing 90-minute tickets \(€1.40\) when you do so or get a 24-hour ticket \(€4.5\). \(Remember, 90-minute tickets, daily, and 5-day tickets are not valid for trips from/to the airport.\)

  For journeys from/to Athens Airport to/from any station within the urban section, metro tickets for the airport are valid.

  The Acropolis is well worth a visit, just to sit in the sun and take in the landscape of what was the hub of a mini empire. The associated museum is... well air conditioned, and the excavated houses with glass above them are nice. However, I prefer wandering around ruins in open air here - the Philopappos Monument and Arch of Hadrian - but especially the Temple of Hephaestus are must-sees.

### Rest of the Greece

**Nafplio**

* go to Nafplio instead. It's a year-round destination just a few hours' driving distance from Athens and it will give you an island-like experience with much much more to see and do. It's a very scenic and romantic spot, so ideal for an anniversary trip.

  Nafplio is amazing and it should be advertised more to tourists

  total time from Athens is 2h 10'. If you find the departure time convenient it will provide you a more comfortable cheap and accurate journey. 17e for a two way ticket \(in two parts, one till Korinthos, one for the rest\)[\[6\]](http://tickets.trainose.gr/dromologia/). Stops also at [Argos](https://wikitravel.org/en/Argos) and [Mycenae](https://wikitravel.org/en/Mycenae)

* **Santorini**

Oia village - main

The obvious activity is to walk the caldera edge and admire the views. Walks in and around Fira are spectacular, particularly heading north to Firostefani and Imerovigli along the caldera-edge pathway. Keep walking and you’ll eventually reach Oia, but be aware that this is no small undertaking and the trail beyond Imerovigli can be rough. It’s about 9km in all, and a good three- to four-hours’ walk in one direction.

Firostefani - less crowded: [https://www.greeka.com/cyclades/santorini/santorini-villages/santorini-firostefani.htm](https://www.greeka.com/cyclades/santorini/santorini-villages/santorini-firostefani.htm)

Must visit - Lucky's in fira

My recommendation: Stay in one of the four towns \(Fira, Oia, Imerovigli, and Firostafani\) that are located on the Santorini cliff.
