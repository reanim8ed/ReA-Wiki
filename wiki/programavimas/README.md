# Programavimas

## Notes

* _The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak._  Tai viena iš priežasčių, kaip programavimo srityje dažnai apima _Impostor_ sindromas.  Vienas iš svarbiausių React kūrėjų [straipsnyje rašo](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/):

> _First, there is often an unrealistic expectation that an experienced engineer knows every technology in their field. Have you seen a “learning roadmap” that consists of a hundred libraries and tools? It’s useful — but intimidating._

> _What’s more, no matter how experienced you get, you may still find yourself switching between feeling capable, inadequate \(“Impostor syndrome”\), and overconfident \(“Dunning–Kruger effect”\)._

> _We can admit our knowledge gaps, may or may not feel like impostors, and still have deeply valuable expertise that takes years of hard work to develop._

> _I’m aware of my knowledge gaps \(at least, some of them\). I can fill them in later if I become curious or if I need them for a project. This doesn’t devalue my knowledge and experience. There’s plenty of things that I can do well. For example, learning technologies when I need them._
