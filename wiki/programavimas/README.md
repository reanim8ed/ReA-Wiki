# Programavimas

## Notes

* A good engineer never assumes the perfect reliability of the components of the system. He or she builds in redundancy to protect the integrity of the total system.
* Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers.
* Engineering is figuring out how to do what you want with what you’ve actually got
* You can’t guilt yourself into doing things you want to accomplish. You’ll always resist and make excuses. The only way is to enjoy the act of doing them.
* C programmer’s motto: “Build upon the work of others”
* [10x programeriai](http://10x.engineer/) vs [1x programerius](https://1x.engineer/)
* "Premature optimization is the root of all evil". This applies more broadly than just for code. Abstraction is a form of optimization and shouldn't be done before the space has been properly explored to know what abstractions should be built.

### The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak. 

Tai viena iš priežasčių, kaip programavimo srityje dažnai apima _Impostor_ sindromas.   
Vienas iš svarbiausių React kūrėjų [straipsnyje rašo](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/):

> _First, there is often an unrealistic expectation that an experienced engineer knows every technology in their field. Have you seen a “learning roadmap” that consists of a hundred libraries and tools? It’s useful — but intimidating._

> _What’s more, no matter how experienced you get, you may still find yourself switching between feeling capable, inadequate \(“Impostor syndrome”\), and overconfident \(“Dunning–Kruger effect”\)._

> _We can admit our knowledge gaps, may or may not feel like impostors, and still have deeply valuable expertise that takes years of hard work to develop._

> _I’m aware of my knowledge gaps \(at least, some of them\). I can fill them in later if I become curious or if I need them for a project. This doesn’t devalue my knowledge and experience. There’s plenty of things that I can do well. For example, learning technologies when I need them._

### Law of Software Envelopment

> Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.”

Coined by Jamie Zawinski to express his belief that all truly useful programs experience pressure to evolve into toolkits and application platforms \(the mailer thing, he says, is just a side effect of that\).
